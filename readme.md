imitsu Network: A Scalable, Privacy-Preserving, and Secure Blockchain 
Network

Abstract:
This white paper introduces Himitsu Network, a blockchain network built on 
the Cosmos SDK framework, aiming to provide scalability, privacy, and 
security in decentralized systems. Leveraging the widely adopted Cosmos 
SDK, which is used by major cryptocurrency networks such as Binance Coin, 
Cosmos Atom, and Crypto.com's native token CRO, Himitsu Network utilizes a 
proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and a high number of validators. The 
network introduces digital hankos, which are base58 random digital 
fingerprints of random length, as a unique identity verification mechanism 
to enhance account security. Additionally, Himitsu Network facilitates the 
transfer of Himitsu vouchers and Content Identification Locators (CILs) 
such as URLs, Google Drive links, BitTorrent hashes, and IPFS CIDs. The 
native Himitsu application provides a wallet, block explorer, and 
peer-to-peer encrypted messaging capabilities, while also tackling the 
issue of spam. Himitsu Network is open-source, encouraging developers to 
leverage its capabilities to build innovative applications.
